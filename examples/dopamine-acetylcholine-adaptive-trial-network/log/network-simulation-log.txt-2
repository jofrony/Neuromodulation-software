!!! Found 695 synapses on dSPN_2 (14)  that are further than 20 mum away  (out of 711 synapses) Max found was 29 mum from expected location. morphology: /home/jofrony/Documents/Repositories/BasalGangliaPublications/Neuromodulation-software/examples/data/neurons/striatum/dspn/str-dspn-e150917_c10_D1-mWT-P270-20-v20210212/WT-P270-20-15ak-cor-res3.swc
 Check that soma is centered at (0,0,0). Also check that the first dendritic compartment of each dendrite is not too far away from the soma, then NEURON  adds an extra connecting compartment which messes up section IDs.
