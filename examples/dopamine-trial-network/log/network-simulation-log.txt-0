!!! Found 29 synapses on dSPN_1 (2)  that are further than 20 mum away  (out of 29 synapses) Max found was 31 mum from expected location. morphology: /home/jofrony/Documents/Repositories/BasalGangliaPublications/Neuromodulation-software/examples/data/neurons/striatum/dspn/str-dspn-e150917_c10_D1-mWT-P270-20-v20210212/WT-P270-20-15ak-cor-res3.swc
 Check that soma is centered at (0,0,0). Also check that the first dendritic compartment of each dendrite is not too far away from the soma, then NEURON  adds an extra connecting compartment which messes up section IDs.
