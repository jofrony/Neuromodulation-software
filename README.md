Neuromodulation - optimization and large scale simulations using <a href="https://github.com/Hjorthmedh/Snudda" target="_blank">Snudda</a>, by Johannes Hjorth


# Example simulations

In the folder, examples, there are simulations using Snudda (both replay and adaptive). These examples require that Snudda is installed on your loca machine (including NEURON). 

Follow instructions in the notebooks (jupyter).
